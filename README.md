# 🧪 Diabetic Medication Necessity Model

## 🎯 Aim of this Project
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to determine whether patients need Diabetic Medication. It leverages various machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict medication requirements.

## 📖 Description
This Jupyter notebook contains a detailed analysis and model building process for predicting the necessity of diabetic medication in patients. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of machine learning algorithms.

## 📚 Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib.pyplot`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn` (including various submodules like decomposition, cluster, model_selection, preprocessing, linear_model, metrics, ensemble)
- `yellowbrick.cluster`
- `warnings`
